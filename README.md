# SmartWing_ADSA

The project consists in developing a part of the code of a smart Wing.  
We are interested in the phase of acceleration, descent and circular flight around coordinates of take-off.
The idea of this project is to code trajectories and to extract an image of the trajectory and a text file with the commands to be transmitted to the wing.

## Plan de vol

* acceleration
* rotation
* ascension
* mise en palier
* stabilisation
* mise en position
* plan de vol circulaire autour de coordonnées de décollage
* mise en position
* descente
* approche
* arrondi
* touch down
